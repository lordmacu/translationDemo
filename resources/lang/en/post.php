<p>It\'s been almost 2 years since the announcement of the first pro competitions of the Blizzard franchise, Overwatch. It was a prominent start, with major promoters of leagues such as ESL and MLG organizing LAN tournaments, and the most important teams in the world, such as Cloud9 and Ninjas in Pajamas, forming new teams.</p>
<p>Then announced in the BlizzCon of 2016 the launch of the Overwatch League (OWL), a league with franchises based in specific cities and without declines, much like the American sports leagues - MLS, NFL, MLB-. But the announcement slowed down the competitive scene.</p>
<p>Last year, important LAN competitions were held and only in Asia, making it difficult to see the events in our time zone. And since the announcement of the OWL, the promoters such as ESL, DreamHack, MLG, FACEIT and ELEAGUE, which organized important events in the past, have stopped partially or completely supporting the competitions; decision that many eSports organizations followed, such as Team Dignitas, Fnatic, compLexity, eliminating their Overwatch teams.</p>
<p>Blizzard is a company known for always wanting to have complete control of its brands, to the point of molding the community at ease.</p>
<p>The Overwatch League, Season 1. Blizzard announced the OWL with one intention: to ensure the success of Overwatch as an eSport, and to maintain full control of its franchise.</p>
<p>The inaugural season, which started on January 10, has twelve teams, nine from the United States and one from England, China and South Korea, each of which paid 20 million dollars to obtain the franchise. All games this season will be played in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The minimum wage for the players is $ 50,000, and they must be guaranteed housing, health insurance and retirement savings, among other benefits.</p>
<p>The competition is divided into two divisions of six teams, with four stages that will last five dates with Bo5 matches. The best six teams advance to the postseason that will be in July of this year.</p>
<p>At the moment the five dates of the first stage have been played and until now it can be said that the debut has been a success, with up to 440,000 spectators. The production of Blizzard has paid attention to the smallest detail, from the game room to the transmission of the event, everything has been up to the expectations that you have the giant American company.</p>
<p>The Future of Overwatch As E-Sport.</p>
<p>One doubt echoes in the forums of the web: Is Overwatch, as a game, worthy of so much fuss, interest and efforts? For many OW it is a fun game to play but not so much to watch. With so many changes of maps and objectives in each round, 26 characters with different kits and abilities, added to the frantic pace of the game, makes it easy to see why many find it difficult to follow and understand the games.</p>
<p>The future of this game as eSport will depend on the success or not of this season of the Overwatch League. Whatever may attract the casual viewer, and not just hardcore, it may also be a factor to consider.</p>
<p>What is certain is that this change of focus in which the game publishers are more involved in the production of tournaments and the franchise model presented by Blizzard, will bring changes in the future to all areas of the eSport, both in the players, teams, fans and leagues.</p>','news_content_152' => '<p>jhgjhgjhgjhgkjhgkgkjhgk</p>','news_content_153' => '<p>Torneo clasificatorio WESG</p>

<p>Equipo a destacar : Isurus Gaming en el torneo fue un equipo que demostró un gran nivel jugando una gran fase de grupos y una excelente final vs team one brindando un gran espectáculo, tiene grandes jugadores capaces de resolver cualquier situación de clutch y con buenas strats que lo hacen un equipo temible.</p>
<p>Gabriel “1962” Sinopoli fue su top fragger logrando un score de 72-64 en el torneo. Sin duda un gran player que logró acoplarse a los tiburones rapidamente luego de su breve estancia en Estados Unidos con Doral Flamingos.</p>

For the second half NAVI came out determined to fight Astralis, winning the first three rounds to get 9-9. However, the Astralis player, \"gla1ve\", left a great performance with 22 kills including 11 headshots, which helped to break the economy of NAVI, and thus lead his team to become champion of DreamHack Marseille and take the prize $ 100,000. </ p> <p> Another excellent grand final that these great teams give us in which we can see good defense and strategies, very good plays and the individual talent of each of the players. It was a final where we saw an Immense Astralis that will be one of the favorites to take any future event. </ P> <p> </ p> <p> Source: https://www.hltv.org/news/23384 / astralis-beat-navi-to-win-dreamhack-masters-marseille </ p>','news_content_181' => '<p>content traduction</p>','news_content_182' => '<p>test content</p>','news_content_183' => '<p>contenido de prueba para traducciones</p>','news_content_184' => '<p>contenido de prueba para traduccion</p>','news_content_185' => '<p>dassadsad</p>','news_content_186' => '<p>contenido para traducciones</p>','news_content_187' => '<p>contenido para noticia nueva con traduccion</p>','news_content_188' => '<p>contenido editado new 188</p>','news_content_191' => '<p>contenido para nicia con traduccion</p>','news_content_195' => '<p>LAS PRUEBAS DE ALELI SON MALAS</p>','news_content_196' => '<p>ES LA PRUEBA DE LUIS A FULLL</p>','news_content_197' => '<p>fds </p>','news_content_198' => '<p>qwwwwwwwwwwww</p>','news_content_200' => '<p>test new6</p>','news_content_201' => '<p>test dev4</p>','news_content_202' => '<p>fdsf</p>','news_content_203' => '<p>gfdgfdg</p>','news_content_204' => '<p>dsfdsfsad</p>','news_content_205' => '<p>fdsfdsfdsfdsfs</p>','news_content_233' => '<p>test</p>','news_content_236' => '<p>fdsfds</p>','news_content_237' => '<p>fdsfds</p>','news_content_238' => '<p>fdsfdsx</p>','news_content_239' => '<p>dsfsdfsdfdsfdsfsdfsdf</p>','news_content_240' => '<p>yreyreyreyreyre</p>','news_content_242' => '<p>dstgsdggd</p>','news_content_243' => '<p>dwqdwqdqwdwqdwqdqwddwdwqw</p>','news_content_244' => '<p>gregwrgergw</p>','news_content_245' => '<p>dsadsadsa</p>','news_excerpt_116' => 'excert','news_excerpt_120' => 'son los titulos','news_excerpt_123' => 'las noticias','news_excerpt_124' => 'destacado','news_excerpt_134' => 'Team Perú, SG e-sports y Pain Gaming move on to the next phase.
